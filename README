NeoType
=======

Tired of needing to go to a website powered by bloated JavaScript just to do a typing test?

Fear no more, for NeoType is here! It runs in your UNIX terminal and is powered by classic ANSI escape codes!

$ cd neotype
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/neotype && cp share/* ~/.local/share/neotype
$ go build

Note: the above commands will compile neotype, but a pre-compiled binary is also provided on the releases page.

Usage
=====

Just run 'neotype' to start, optionally provide a number of words ('neotype --words x').
